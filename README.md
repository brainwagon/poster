# poster

I have some images with a 2:3 aspect ratio that I wished to print as a 20"x30" poster, to match the 
size of "Readibord" which sells for a mere $1.50 at Dollar Tree.  There exists a program called "poster"
which purports to be able to do that, but I found that it was difficult to get it to print exactly to size.
Perhaps I'm just dumb, but I couldn't figure out the combination of arguments to get the precise size, so
I thought (at 5:30AM) that I could write something that would do the trick.

Note to self: I think the Readiboard is actually only 20"x29.75".  But I can finesse that later.
